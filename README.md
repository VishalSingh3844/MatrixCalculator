A React application that allows users to generate two random matrices, compute their element-wise product, and add the matrices together. The app uses Material UI for its user interface components.

Features

• Random Matrix Generation: Create two matrices with random numbers. • Element-wise Product: Display the product of corresponding elements in the two matrices. • Matrix Addition: Add the matrices together with a single click. • Validation: Input fields are validated to ensure that required values are provided.

Prerequisites
